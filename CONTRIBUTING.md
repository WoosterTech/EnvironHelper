# Contributing to EnvironHelper

First off, thank you for considering contributing to EnvironHelper. My skills for something like this are limited, but this tool has been something I've been looking for and decided to make something, anything, to make this easier.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [Issues](https://github.com/WoosterTech/EnvironHelper/issues) if there's already a ticket for it. If there isn't, feel free to [open a new one](https://github.com/WoosterTech/EnvironHelper/issues/new).

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork EnvironHelper](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be _325-add-japanese-localization_ (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-localization
```
